# Top $`k`$ elements and $`k`$-th element

Two twists on the same idea that show up frequently in coding interviews in various incarnations:

 - given an unsorted array of objects of length $`n`$, find the top $`k`$ objects based on a given comparison function
 - given an unsorted array of objects of length $`n`$, find $`k`$-th object based on a given comparion function, that is an object that would appear at the $`k`$ place in an sorted array


```C++ runnable
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```
